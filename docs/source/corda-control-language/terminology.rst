==================
Terminology
==================

There are two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.

The terminology here must be consistent and where possible aligned to existing commonly used terminology. But as one
problem is the existing inconsistency and ambiguity, this may not always be so easy.


Zone
====

A Zone defines the common set of rules and services which all Nodes under the Zone must obey. This include root keys
for signing hierarchies and also legal and commercial terms. Zones are hierarchical and there is always a top level Root Zone.

It is impossible to transact across Root Zones. It is difficult but not impossible to transact across Zone.
Zone Operators decide what the rules are. Setting up a Zone is complex and expensive.

Nodes can connect directly to a Zone, but it is more usual to join a Network.
