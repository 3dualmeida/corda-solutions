How Do Business Networks Start?
-------------------------------

Now we have an idea of what a business network is, we might now ask how a Corda business network gets started?

There is no single approach that describes this, but there are a few common routes.  Sometimes a business network
already exists, and it simply adopts Corda, while in other cases a governing consortium might be pulled together first.
Another route is that software developers find an opportunity to build out a business network from a prototype or
proof-of-concept design.  It is worth noting that while there are many possible journeys to creating a Corda
business network, the outcome is, generally, similar.

Top-Down (Business-Led)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A top-down journey usually starts by recognising a valuable business problem, identifying likely participants,
and, perhaps, the creation of a new venture, or consortium.  Typically, this route requires the creation and adoption of
technical standards, along with definition of governance principles.  This usually evolves to include
specialised resources such as Corda developers and legal advisors.

It is possible that a suitable structure already exists, so in these cases our goal is to adopt, or evolve, its
business model, and to embrace as many of its existing governing policies and procedures as make sense.

Bottom-Up (Technology-Led)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes a business network comes about as the result of a developer or technology team building a prototype,
or proof-of-concept, of some interesting technology idea that can be applied to a business problem.  In these
cases, the technology has to be matched to a suitable problem and governance structure.  While it may be easy to
dismiss this as a solution looking for a problem, there has been a surprising degree of success with this type
of approach, and this embraces the possibility of very simple solutions to non-controversial problems.

Adoptive
^^^^^^^^

In some instances, a structure similar to a Corda business network may already exist, so it would be wise to consider
adopting it.  It may be possible to leverage existing governing policies and operational procedures
where they are applicable, and modifying them were necessary to accomodate the blockchain nuances.
