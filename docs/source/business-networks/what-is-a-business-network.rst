What is a Business Network?
---------------------------

If a business network is a group of independent parties transacting together, then its purpose is to allow its
members to create a shared representation of information, or facts, and to then use shared processing of those
facts to achieve agreement, or consensus, about operations involving them.

This ability to enable both shared understanding of facts, and shared understanding about how they are to be used
is something uniquely powerful within DLT/blockchain systems.  Earlier systems focused on the shared representations
of information, but could neither consistently guarantee its correctness, nor ensure that all participants processed
things in the same way.  The Corda promise is that "I know I see what you see" after each operation to which we are both
a participant.

The use of shared business logic is necessary to ensure correctness, but also offers a new opportunity.  Where
our transacting parties are all required to perform similar business processes then this can be designed into the
CorDapp(s) that are developed.  This means that when it comes to integrate Corda business networks into
new, or existing, systems, that total integration effort is notably lowered, as each participant is not left
duplicating the same basic functionality.

The model of Corda business networks also enables something particularly powerful.  It allows for the possibility
that one business network can build upon the work of another, and that others can then build on top of that.

However, while Corda enables business networks, it deliberately sets out to have few "opinions" about what they might be, or exactly how they should work.  Instead, Corda attempts to define some mechanisms to allow for the
construction of business networks, and leaves the rest rather open-ended.  This flexibility means it is possible
to build both very simple and very complex designs, but, as with most software, over-simplified designs often
miss essential functionality, while over-complex ones are almost impossible to get right.
