Business Network Playbook
-------------------------

Having set the scene for Corda business networks, it is useful to think about some specific tasks and their
implications for how any particular business network will operate.  We introduce some thoughts in the form
of a "playbook".

The playbook is not intended to be exhaustive and is a living document.  More content will be added as
everyone gains insight into what makes for the best practices for all participants within a Corda business
network ecosystem.
