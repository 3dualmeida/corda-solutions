Roles and Responsibilities
--------------------------

We have considered how Corda business networks are started and have seen that the process leads to some sort of governing entity.  That governing entity addresses the strategic business and technical needs of the users of the business network's services, but does not address the tactical, operational needs.  Similarly, our users have not really been considered at this point, so it is worth exploring these key roles.

It is worth noting that these roles do not come in one size and may, for example, represent an individual, a
company, or a consortium.

Business Network Governor (BNG)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Business Network Governor (BNG) is responsible for the strategic management and governance policies of the
business network, and is accountable for the implementation and enforcement of those policies.

- Defines the legal and regulatory basis on which the business network operates.
- Establishes and controls any technical standards associated with the business network's activities.
- Sources and maintains the CorDapp (and other) software necessary to meet the needs of the business network.
- Determines how the business network will be operated and supported.

It is sometimes argued that if we were to build a truly decentralised business network then there is not role for
a BNG, but even the decision to make the network decentralised implies a specific governance decision.  The BNG may
not be readily visible, but does not go away.

Business Network Operator (BNO)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Business Network Operator (BNO) is responsible for the tactical day to day management of the business network.

- Implements and enforces the policies established by the BNG.
- Manages membership of the business network.
- Handles marketing, promotion, and any other day to day organisational services, that are required to operate a healthy
  business network.
- Provides, or arranges for, support for problems encountered by the business network's users.
- Provides reporting to the BNG.

It is worth nothing that for some business networks the BNG and BNO role may be fulfilled by the same organisation.

Business Network User (BNU)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A business network user makes use of the services offered by the business network.  There may be many different
types of user, depending on the application.
