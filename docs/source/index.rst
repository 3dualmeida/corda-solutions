Welcome to Corda Solutions!
===========================

What does it take to build a solution to a distributed problem using Corda?  This seems like an easy question, but it's
trickier than might first appear.  Distributed and, in particular, decentralised problems typically need to address
questions around how all of the participants come to agreements, and this needs more than just code to achieve it.

`Corda <https://www.corda.net/>`_ provides the technical capabilities we need to build these sorts of solutions, but how
should we think about these other issues?  When we have thought about them, then are there specific technical
approaches that we should use?

This site aims to ask some of these questions and offer some solutions.
